# Arithmetic Parser
Implement a parser to take a string and compute its numerical value using the given rules.  
Operators should be applied in order of precedence from left to right.  
An exception to this is brackets which are used to explicitly denote precedence by grouping parts of an expression that should be evaluated first.

Rules:  
a = ‘+’, b = ‘-’, c = ‘*’, d = ‘/’, e = ‘(’, f = ‘)’
